                 as well as It is distinguished by its familiar front and referred to as a Porsche with the presence of the large triple air inlets, and the headlights are somewhat oval in shape and extend to the top in an attractive way, and what makes the new car stand out are the rear lights that extend fully to the sides in three dimensions (LED) ).
                  On the inside, the Porsche Macan is distinguished by the presence of many buttons arranged around the transmission in a regular manner, while the infotainment touch screen is placed in a size 10.9 inches in the center of the dashboard with fewer buttons than in previous models. The rest of the cabin is typical of Porsche designs;
                   Sports seats, small steering wheel, and left-hand drive operation.
