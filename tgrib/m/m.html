            <p>Mercedes is a German global automobile company and a subsidiary of Daimler AG, whose brand is known for luxury cars, buses and trucks. Headquartered in Stuttgart,
             Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the name first appeared in 1926 during the reign of Daimler-Benz. In 2018, Mercedes was the best-selling brand luxury cars in the world, and
             Its origins go back to Karl Benz's creation of the first gasoline-powered automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, funded by Bertha Benz,
             which was patented in January 1886 and converted into a passenger airliner by adding a gasoline engine later that year.</p>
